# keystroke.js

keystroke.js is a fun "game" where you type letters that get bigger and bigger. These letters all have different weights that can sink a ship they float on.

## What's the purpose of it?

It was just fun. I did it while I had nothing to do in school.

## Will it be updated?

Sure. Whenever I have ideas for enhancements I will update it.
